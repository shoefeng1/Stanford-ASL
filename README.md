Routing algorithm for Autonomous Mobility on Demand (AMoD), a future transportation system.
Uses the branch-and-bound integer optimization algorithm to ensure that integer amounts of cars are assigned to roads.
Speeds up branch-and-bound with a neural network that outputs the optimal ordering of customer requests.
